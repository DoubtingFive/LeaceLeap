# LeaceLeap
Movement-based, arcade game. This is my first time making physic-based movement in 3D. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the level in the shortest time possible.

## Mechanics
The new movement is easier and has different mechanics. By jumping you gain forward speed.

## Old movement
I made this movement too complicated, so I am working at making it simple.

In big shortcut: holding space or move keys is making you slower, this mechanic isn't fun.


## Commands
 - timescale [scale] | Scales time to the provided value
 - sens [sensitivity] | Sets mouse sensitivity to value
 - toggleSpeed | Toggles the console that shows the speed
